NOTES TO SELF (awae)
====================
TILE ENTITIES MUST FEATURE AN EMPTY CONSTRUCTOR!
MAKE SURE TO STORE ALL TILE ENTITY DATA IN NBT TAG!
DURING WORLD LOADING THE EMPTY CONSTRUCTOR IS INVOKED AND THE NBT TAG IS PROVIDED. RECONSTRUCT DATA FROM THERE!

on world load the cached blockMetadata value of TileEntities is not updated (indicated by a value of -1)
Therefore use getBlockMetadata() instead, as this function does update the cached value if necessary. By using
this method instead of the direct cache no further cache update techniques have to be used.
