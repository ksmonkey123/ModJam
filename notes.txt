MCP Conf dir for deobfuscator
=============================

Incase you are asked by eclipse:
Put MCP conf folder for the deobfuscator here:
	gradleUserHome\caches\minecraft\net\minecraftforge\forge\1.7.X-your forge version-\unpacked\conf
probably the gradleUserHome dir is in your user directory (c:/benutzer/name/)


JUNIT (j)
====================
I put JUnit into the source folder together with hamcrest-core (which is needed by junit). The new source unitTests can
be added and used for junit tests.

steps:
- right click in eclipse on unitTests folder -> add as source Folder
- right click in eclipse on junit.jar -> add to build path
  same goes for hamcrest-core.jar


NOTES TO SELF (awae)
====================
TILE ENTITIES MUST FEATURE AN EMPTY CONSTRUCTOR!
MAKE SURE TO STORE ALL TILE ENTITY DATA IN NBT TAG!
DURING WORLD LOADING THE EMPTY CONSTRUCTOR IS INVOKED AND THE NBT TAG IS PROVIDED. RECONSTRUCT DATA FROM THERE!

on world load the cached blockMetadata value of TileEntities is not updated (indicated by a value of -1)
Therefore use getBlockMetadata() instead, as this function does update the cached value if necessary. By using
this method instead of the direct cache no further cache update techniques have to be used.
