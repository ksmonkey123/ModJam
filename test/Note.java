/**
 * FIXME: this note is just to let you know, that we should all update to MC 1.7.10 with the new
 * latest forge version. This is done as follows: <br>
 * <br>
 * 1. change line 25 in the file build.gradle to match the following line:<br>
 * version = "1.7.10-10.13.0.1187"<br>
 * <br>
 * 2. in the same directory run the following shell command:<br>
 * gradlew setupDecompWorkspace<br>
 * <br>
 * FIXME: I created a new branch for the mod dev in mc 1.7.10, please change to this branch when you updated your forge<br>
 * FIXME: the same goes for the git repo with mods, I updated some of them also in the new branch dedicated for mc 1.7.10
